## what is 42?
42 is the first computer programming school that is entirely free and available to students with or without degrees who are 18-years or older. Its teaching methods are based on peer learning: no teachers, no lectures, fully hands on. 42 allows students to free their creativity through project learning.

* **NO COURSES. NO TEACHERS. NO CLASSES:**<br>
Thanks to its innovative teaching methods, 42 is able to offer training par excellence without resorting to lectures. The pedagogical staff is available to help the students find their own solutions. In order to progress at 42, you have to work in groups, lean with the community to overcome challenges and then, share your experience with your peers. You don’t learn programming by copying algorithms on paper!

* **A PROJECT METHOD:**<br>
At 42, students act for their own success within a 100% practical curriculum. Surpassing oneself is the only way to move forward: You can always count on the strength of the group; give and share information, as well as learn and train at the same time. This growing collective intelligence helps students understand how a professional environment works. Each part must rely on the other in order to properly achieve a project.

* **FAILING IS PROGRESSING**<br>
At 42, failing is not the end. It is AN end. It’s the path to success: test a program, understand your mistakes, correct them and move forward. At 42, you are rewarded for finding your own solutions. This is not about mindlessly copying a model. Achievement is the only thing that matters, whichever path you use to reach it.

* **PEER-TO-PEER LEARNING**<br>
If you apply to 42, don’t expect a “knowledgeable” person to teach you anything. You have to find the answers by yourself or ask fellow students to show you and explain things that you in turn will learn and transmit to someone else. This method allows you to move forward and sharpen your skills through research, experimentation and defending your personal approach to a given problem.

* **PEER-TO-PEER EVALUATION**<br>
In classical learning, evaluation happens at the end of the curriculum. At 42, this is when you learn the most. Peer evaluation requires students to evaluate each other’s work with the help of a grading scale established by the pedagogical staff. This system supports dialogue and allows sharing advice that will help students move forward and seek alternative methods. There is never one specific answer at 42. There is not one single model you must reproduce and learn by heart.

* **GROUP WORK IS NOT CHEATING**<br>
In a classroom, it’s usually ill-advised to join forces or share advice in order to solve a problem. At 42, it’s the other way around. When projects get too tough to tackle, creating a group helps share different points of view. By approaching someone struggling with the same problem, you can share your thoughts and perspectives. Everyone brings something so that, together, you can understand and remember the keys to achieving a project.
